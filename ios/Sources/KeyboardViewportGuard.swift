//
//  KeyboardViewportGuard.swift
//  tauri-plugin-system-components
//
//  Keeps the webview's layout viewport honest across keyboard transitions.
//
//  While a text field is focused, WebKit shrinks the webview's LAYOUT viewport
//  by the height of the input accessory bar (the "^ v … Done" toolbar) — not
//  just the visual viewport. `window.innerHeight`, `100dvh` and the containing
//  block of every `position: fixed` element all lose those points, which is
//  correct while the bar is on screen. What is not correct is that iOS
//  frequently never gives them back: dismissing the keyboard leaves the layout
//  viewport short (44pt with a hardware keyboard, 53pt with the software one),
//  and it stays short for the life of the web view — reloading the page does
//  not clear it, because the state lives in the native view, not the document.
//
//  Everything anchored to the bottom then floats that far above the screen: a
//  bottom nav bar hovers over a band of dead space, a `100dvh` pane strands the
//  composer pinned to its bottom, and no CSS can reach the gap, because content
//  below the layout viewport is clipped rather than drawn.
//
//  There is no web-facing API for any of this, so restore it from here: once
//  the keyboard has actually left, hand WebKit a size it has not seen and put
//  the real one straight back. That round trip is what makes it re-measure and
//  republish the full height to the web process.
